## Overview

I built a responsive news homepage as part of the Frontend Mentor challenge. The project focuses on creating an optimal layout for different screen sizes and implementing interactive UI elements.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

# ### Screenshot

Here is a screenshot of the completed interface, showcasing the hover states and the full responsive layout:

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap 5


### What I learned

Through this News homepage challenge, I learned how to structure HTML effectively and create responsive layouts using CSS Grid. I also gained experience integrating the Bootstrap framework to streamline styling and ensure consistency across different devices.



### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to explore and integrate additional frameworks to broaden my development skills and experience with different technologies.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Provided comprehensive documentation on CSS Grid, which was invaluable for building the responsive layout.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the Frontend Mentor community for providing such a valuable platform to practice and improve my skills through these challenges. I am eager to try the Pro challenges as well, but due to payment limitations as an African student, I am currently unable to access them.
